Pneumonia is an infectious disease that inflames the air sacs in the lungs. It may occur in one or both the lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough followed by phlegm or pus, fever, chills and difficulty in breathing. The causes of pneumonia can be a variety of organisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. A person suffering from pneumonia apart from suffering from difficulty in respiration, can also suffer from other complications such as bacteremia, lung abscess, pleural effusion and among countless others. 
This model presents a efficient and enhanced method for diagnosis of pnuemonia using deep residual learning along with seperable convolutional networks. 
The images were CXR (Chest-X-ray images) in grayscale format obtained from the mendeley CXR data available at kaggle [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/parthachakraborty/pneumonia-chest-x-ray) 
The model developed using deep residual learning along with separable convolutional network is given below:
